Co-opvid is a fun little multiplayer trivia game all about COVID-19! Below you'll see a Game Creation menu, and underneath that lies the lobby, where you can join other games. When people join the lobby and you press Start, you will automatically be placed into teams.

The goal of each game is to fill in the missing letters of a word by answering COVID-related questions. If you get the question correct, one letter will go into the right spot. However, if you get it wrong, an incorrect letter will go into that spot. You can use the previous letters to help you guess if you can't narrow the answer down to one choice. 

Each game has exactly 8 questions for you to enjoy. At the end of the round, you will see your score and your opponents score. Have fun!
